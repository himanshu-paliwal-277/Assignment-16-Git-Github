Explain what version control is and its importance in software development

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

With version control software, every change made to the code base is tracked. This allows software developers to see the entire history of who changed what at any given time and roll back from the current version to an earlier version if they need to. It also creates a single source of truth.

Some importance of version control software in software development-

History Tracking: 

Version control systems maintain a history of changes made in files. Each change is recorded along with information about who made the change, when it was made, and what was changed.

Collaboration: 

In a collaborative environment, multiple developers may be working on the same project simultaneously. Version control allows developers to work on their copies of files independently and merge their changes later. This avoids conflicts and ensures a streamlined collaborative process.

Parallel Development: 

Version control software are multiple features or bug fixes can be developed in parallel. Each developer can work on their task without disrupting others, and the changes can be integrated seamlessly when ready.

Branching and Merging: 

Version control systems support branching, allowing developers to create separate lines of development. This is useful for working on new features, bug fixes, or experimental changes without affecting the main codebase. Merging enables the integration of changes from one branch to another, facilitating the combination of different development efforts.
