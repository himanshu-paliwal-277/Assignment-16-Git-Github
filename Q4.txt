alternatives to GitHub.

GitHub is a cloud based service. It is a web-based platform for software development. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. GitHub makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.

Version Control: 

GitHub leverages Git for version control, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage codebase history.

Collaboration Tools: 

GitHub provides tools for issue tracking, project management, and code review. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently, making it easier to collaborate on software development.

Forks and Pull Requests: 

Users can fork a repository (create their own copy) and propose changes back to the original project through pull requests. This enables a streamlined process for collaboration and code contributions.

Branching and Merging: 

GitHub supports branching, allowing developers to work on separate features or fixes independently. Changes made in branches can be merged back into the main codebase.

Community and Social Coding: 

GitHub fosters a sense of community by allowing developers to follow projects, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects. It serves as a platform for social coding and collaboration.
